This 2 player game is made for friends who think they can communicate. You are trapped in a haunted house and your job is to escape,
before that clock hits midnight. Along with your ghostly friend, solve riddles, complete puzzles and explore this haunted place,
all while using your ghostly friend trapped inside a totem.
Are you up for the challenge? Or will you be trapped in this haunted house forever?

There are 2 aspects to this game. 1 person will be playing in VR and is able to interact with the world around them,
while the second player, will use their phone and it's features (such as gyroscope and touch input) to see around the room in a way the player in VR can't.
The player on their phone is not able to move on its own and needs help from the VR player to look throughout the room.
